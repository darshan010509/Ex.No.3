REPORT: Designing an AI-Powered Customer Support Chatbot Using Unit-2 Prompt Types
AIM

To design an AI-powered customer support chatbot capable of assisting customers with product troubleshooting, order tracking, and general inquiries. The experiment applies Unit-2 prompt patterns—Straightforward Prompts, Tabular Format Prompting, and Preceding Question Prompting—to a Unit-5 use case (AI chatbot development). The goal is to analyze how these different prompt types influence chatbot behavior and improve its overall efficiency and conversational performance.

PROCEDURE

Identify the Use Case (Unit 5):
AI-powered customer support chatbot for handling FAQs, troubleshooting, and order status queries.

Select Prompt Types (Unit 2):

Straightforward Prompts

Tabular Format Prompting

Preceding Question Prompting

Design prompts for each method and execute them using an AI platform.

Observe the responses for accuracy, clarity, completeness, and consistency.

Analyze how each prompt type influences the chatbot’s output quality.

Prepare the report with algorithms, conclusion, and results.

ALGORITHM 1: Straightforward Prompts
Definition:

A direct, simple prompt that asks the AI to perform a specific task without additional structure.

Steps:

Provide a single, clear question or command.

Ensure it targets the task directly (no context layering).

Evaluate the AI output for clarity and correctness.

Example Prompt for Chatbot Design:

“Explain how the chatbot should respond to a customer asking: ‘My product is not turning on. What should I do?’”

Expected Behavior:

Clear troubleshooting steps

Friendly tone

No additional prompting required

ALGORITHM 2: Tabular Format Prompting
Definition:

Prompts that instruct the AI to organize responses in a structured table format.

Steps:

Specify the table columns and required information.

Ask the AI to fill content relevant to chatbot functions.

Analyze how structure improves readability.

Example Prompt:

“Create a table showing three customer issues and how the chatbot should respond. Include columns: Issue Type, Example Customer Query, Chatbot Response.”

Expected Behavior:

Cleanly formatted table

Categorized responses

Helpful for chatbot workflow design

ALGORITHM 3: Preceding Question Prompting
Definition:

This prompt style gives an initial question that the AI must answer before addressing the final prompt. It helps the AI build context.

Steps:

Provide an initial question to activate reasoning.

Follow with the main task.

Ensure the AI uses the earlier answer to enhance the final output.

Example Prompt:

“What are the common customer support issues in e-commerce? Based on your answer, design a chatbot response for each issue.”

Expected Behavior:

Context-aware responses

Better depth since AI “thinks” before producing final output

More aligned chatbot design flow

CONCLUSION

Using different Unit-2 prompt patterns significantly impacts the quality of responses generated for designing an AI customer support chatbot.

Straightforward Prompts give quick, clear outputs suitable for simple tasks.

Tabular Format Prompting improves organization, making it ideal for structuring chatbot workflows.

Preceding Question Prompting increases reasoning depth and enables context-rich responses.

These prompt types together help build a more efficient, user-friendly, and context-aware AI chatbot for resolving customer issues effectively.

RESULT

The various prompt types—Straightforward, Tabular Format, and Preceding Question Prompting—were successfully applied to the chatbot use case. Each method generated appropriate outputs according to its design pattern. The experiment confirmed that structured prompt engineering enhances chatbot reliability, conversational flow, and response accuracy in customer support applications.
