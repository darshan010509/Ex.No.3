To write prompts for four prompting techniques—Straightforward Prompts, Tabular Format Prompting, Preceding Question Prompting, and Missing Word Prompting—and evaluate them using a use case from Unit 5: Machine Learning (Spam Email Classification).

USE CASE SELECTED (Unit 5)

Spam Email Classification using Machine Learning
This use case explains how emails are classified as “spam” or “not spam” using algorithms such as Naïve Bayes or Logistic Regression.

REPORT USING UNIT 2 PROMPT TYPES
1. Straightforward Prompts
Prompt Examples

“Define spam email classification in one sentence.”

“List three algorithms commonly used for spam detection.”

Model Output

“Spam email classification is the process of automatically identifying and filtering unwanted or harmful emails using machine learning models.”

“Three commonly used algorithms are Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines.”

2. Tabular Format Prompting
Prompt

“Create a table comparing three machine learning algorithms used for spam classification, including accuracy, speed, and ease of implementation.”

Model Output (Table)
Algorithm	Accuracy	Speed	Ease of Implementation
Naïve Bayes	High	Very Fast	Easy
Logistic Regression	High	Moderate	Moderate
SVM	Very High	Slow	Hard
3. Preceding Question Prompting
Prompt

“Why is spam classification important? Explain how machine learning identifies spam emails.”

Model Output

Spam classification is important because it prevents phishing attacks, protects user data, and reduces inbox clutter. Machine learning identifies spam emails by learning from labeled examples, extracting features such as keywords or sender patterns, and classifying incoming messages using trained models.

4. Missing Word Prompting
Prompt Examples

“The algorithm commonly used for spam filtering due to its speed and simplicity is ____.”

“Spam emails often contain suspicious links and ____ content.”

Model Output

Naïve Bayes

malicious

CONCLUSION

The four different prompt types—straightforward prompts, tabular format prompting, preceding question prompting, and missing-word prompting—were successfully executed for the selected Unit 5 use case.

RESULT

Thus, the prompts were executed successfully, and the sample report was generated using the required prompting techniques.
